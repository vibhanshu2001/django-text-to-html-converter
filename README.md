# django-text-to-html-converter
This is a django based application in which whatever user put in textbook and however he/she formats the text, it will be converted to corresponding html code with the proper styling provided by the user. Ckeditor is being used here as a RichTextField. 
If you want to test the application out then, don't hesitate to direct message me. I will be happy to start the server once again for you.ðŸ˜„
